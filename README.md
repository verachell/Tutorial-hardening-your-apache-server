# Tutorial-hardening-your-apache-server
A step by step tutorial of some changes to make to the default Apache installation on a Linux VPS server. For beginners

This tutorial follows on from https://github.com/verachell/tutorial-setup-linux-VPS-server-with-apache and assumes you have completed the steps in that tutorial.

Please read this README file completely before moving on to the tutorial (in this repo's Wiki - link below)

## These settings are not suitable for every application
In particular, some of the settings in this tutorial will NOT work with Rails. Also, what constitutes a suitable level of security for your application is up to you. These settings are my defaults for many of the applications I use, but as the license says, I am not responsible for any damages, security breaches, etc from any security holes in the setup in this tutorial. 

It is up to YOU to ensure your server is set up appropriately and securely for YOUR purpose.

I have made a good faith effort to ensure sensible choices are made, but understand that this tutorial is just a starting point. The suggested security measures here may not be appropriate for your application.
